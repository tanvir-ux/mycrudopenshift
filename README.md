Note:

There are few flaws in the app, as in if you just update, without adding, or select an element, and modify it add it, and then click update; you might enter a Stringified key for that 'name' json object, in the mongoDB.
The default key type is a Json Object in MongoDB.

I will soon, test it and get rid of this bug.
